#### Steps to monitor Server Performance using Task Manager:

Press Ctrl + Shift + Esc and it opens Task Manager for you.

Click on the Performance tab to view detailed system information such as Network usage, CPU and you will see graphs and percentages that show the current load on each resource.

CPU usage: Under the CPU section, you can see the current CPU usage percentage. For more detailed information, click on CPU to see individual core performance.

Network usage: The Ethernet or Wi-Fi tab shows the network usage in terms of data sent and received.

#### Steps to monitor Server Performance using Resource Monitor:

Open Resource monitor: You can open Resource Monitor by opening Task Manager and clicking on the Performance tab. At the bottom of the window, click open Resource Monitor.

CPU Tab: The CPU tab shows detailed information on each process using the CPU. It displays information such as the PID (Process ID), Threads, and Handles for each process.

You can also see which processes are using the most CPU resources and monitor CPU utilization for specific cores.

Network Tab: The Network tab shows the network activity of each process, including data sent and received.

You can also view detailed statistics such as the TCP connections, listening ports, and network utilization.

#### Steps To identify performance bottlenecks and resource utilization issues:

Define Performance Metrics: Determine which performance metrics are most relevant to your system or application. 

Monitor Resource Utilization: Use System Monitoring Tools: Use tools like top, htop, Task Manager (Windows), or Activity Monitor (macOS) to monitor CPU, memory, disk I/O, and network utilization.

Analyze Logs and Metrics: Check Logs, Collect Metrics, Identify Trends.

Profile Application Performance: CPU Profiling, Memory Profiling.

Identify Disk I/O Bottlenecks: Monitor Disk Usage, Disk Throughput.
