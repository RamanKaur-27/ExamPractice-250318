In this site, I find 10 different common steps for troubleshooting wireless network connection problems.


(https://www.highspeedinternet.com/resources/no-internet-connection-troubleshooting-guide)

I find 2 quick fixes for internet issues in this site named as restart your modem and router, check your wires and cables.

I also find 3 more ways to fix it like move your router to a better spot, test a different website and check for an outage.

I read in this link that If the internet still down, try using an Ethernet cable to test a connection.
